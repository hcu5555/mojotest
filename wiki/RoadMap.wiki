= Introduction =

Unit testing in ActionScript is nothing new and there are many existing tools for it. Therefore our approach is to make a reduced and easy to use framework that does not require much knowhow and gives you a good start.
Unlike other frameworks the main goal of this project is to try out interesting layouts and visualizations of the test results.

So here is a rough road map:
 
* *Alpha*
 * Basic unit testing capabilities
 * asserts
 * introspection to find the test methods
 * TestCase and TestSuite
 * Test Duration
 * a basic result page, layout is not a list.

* *Beta*
 * Different layouts and visualizations
 * Visualization/metrics on test execution and duration
 * Async Testing
